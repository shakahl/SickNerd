SickNerd
 </h1>

CLI tool for Google Dorking with the ability to fetch and filter dorks from GHDB, save and load results, and search multiple domains. **SickNerd** aims to slowly enumerate Google Dorks via the `googlesearch` API then requests found pages for metadata. By default it sleeps between queries, randomizes
user-agent, retries 429 and failed requests recursively, and prints output after each query. Validation requests can be
done after to grab metadata. 

**SickNerd** comes with a default list of dorks aimed at finding sensitive files but 
accepts input files and can fetch dorks from GHDB. Dorks taken from GHDB can be filtered down by tags and year of creation. Multiple domains can be dorked at once and dorks are run at random. Results and attempted searches are stored in a CSV file and can be loaded to aggregate runs together without duplicating searches.

CLI tool for making Google Dorking a passive recon experience

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Input list of domains (no subdomains).
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Prints and loads CSV files to directory. The default is cwd.
  -f FETCH, --fetch FETCH
                        Fetches lists of dorks from GHDB. Accepts one of the
                        following: all, footholds, dir, web, usernames, servers,
                        errors, juicy, passwords, shopping, login, devices,
                        vulns (optional)
  -d DORKS, --dorks DORKS
                        List of Dorks to test (optional)
  -p, --passive         Skip the validation requests and only do passive
                        checks.
  -q, --quiet           Hides banner
  -y YEARS, --years YEARS
                        Number of years to fetch dorks from. Default is 2.
  -m MAX, --max MAX     Max number of results per query. Default is 30.

Process finished with exit code 0

```

Take a list of domains and google dork them.

```
sicknerd.py -i domains.txt

cat domains.txt | sicknerd.py
```

Skip requesting each URL and only do passive checks.

```
cat domains.txt | sicknerd.py -p
```

Use another list of dorks instead of the defaults

```
cat domains.txt | sicknerd.py -d dorks.txt
```

Only do passive checks, use another list of dorks, and change output directory

```
sicknerd.py -i domains.txt -d dorks.txt -p -o ./dork-out/
